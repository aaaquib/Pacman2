Have you ever wondered or thought that you were a Pro or better than others in Pacman. But you couldn't prove it, could you? 
Well now you can. In Pacman2, 2 players play against each other on the Pacman battleground collecting points and evading enemies.

The objective of the game is to survive longer than the other player. 
If both players survive till the end, the player with the most consumed points wins.
